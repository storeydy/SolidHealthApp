At least one commonly used tool (Webpack) is only able to do that if\r\n    // the module names are literal strings.\r\n    // Additionally, Webpack throws a warning in a way that halts compilation for at least Next.js\r\n    // when using native Javascript dynamic imports (`import()`), whereas `require()` just logs a\r\n    // warning. Since the use of package names instead of file names requires a bundles anyway, this\r\n    // should not have any practical consequences.
